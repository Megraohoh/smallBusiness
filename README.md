# NSS Exercise: Small Business with Data Relationships

### Description:
A small business wants to keep track of its employees and the computers that they use. Each employee is assigned to a department, and they each get assigned a computer when they join the company.

1. Build arrays of objects that represent _Employees_, _Departments_, and _Computers_.
1. Assign every resource a unique `id` property.
1. Assign each employee to a department using a foreign key.
1. Assign each employee a computer using a foreign key.

Once your data is normalized, use your DOM skills to display a card for each employee. It should display the employee name, the name of their department, and which computer they are using
